/**
 * Composition is a restricted form of Aggregation in which two entities (or you
 * can say classes) are highly dependent on each other. For e.g. library can
 * have no. of books on same or different subjects. So, If Library gets
 * destroyed then All books within that particular library will be destroyed.
 * i.e. book can not exist without library. Thatâ€™s why it is composition.
 * 
 * Example : Linear class and TMCs class. If Linear is destroyed. All TMCs
 * within that Linear are destroyed.
 * 
 * one Linear.
